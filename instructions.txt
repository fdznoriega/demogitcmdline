Using the git command line is easy!

--Mac OSX Commands--
cd [directory]      -- lets you traverse
ls                  -- lets you see it all

--GitHub Commands--
git init aRepo      -- will initialize a repository locally
git clone aUrl      -- will pull down a repository from GitHub
git status          -- tells you how far behind/ahead you are
git add fileName    -- adds file to the queue
git commit -m ""    -- prep something for a push into GitHub
git push            -- push files onto GitHub
git pull            -- pull files down from GitHub and have that

--Examples and Scenarios--
For example, let's say I want to add the folly.txt file to this folder.
I would:
  1. Make the folly.txt file.
  2. Add whatever I wanted
  3. Open command line
  4. Go to the directory I am working in
  5. $ git add folly.txt
  6. $ git commit -m "added folly"
  7. $ git push
  8. And we're done

Want to add everything you've got? Easy:
$ git add -A

Random tidbit: get stuck on a screen or commit? ESC:wq

Note that I have been pushing into the MASTER branch all along.
That isn't in the spirit of collaborative work, so what do I do?
